    <h1>A Journey Through Riddles</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time in a quaint village, there lived a wise old owl who loved to challenge travelers with riddles. One day, a curious wanderer decided to seek the owl's wisdom.</p>

    <div class="riddle">
        <p><strong>Riddle 1:</strong> What has keys but can't open locks?</p>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer(1)">Show Answer</button>
        <p class="answer" id="answer1">A piano.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Impressed, the wanderer continued on, and soon came across another challenge.</p>

    <div class="riddle">
        <p><strong>Riddle 2:</strong> What can travel around the world while staying in a corner?</p>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">Show Answer</button>
        <p class="answer" id="answer2">A stamp.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Feeling clever, the wanderer pressed onward, eager to hear more riddles.</p>

    <div class="riddle">
        <p><strong>Riddle 3:</strong> I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?</p>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">Show Answer</button>
        <p class="answer" id="answer3">An echo.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Each riddle brought new excitement, and soon the wanderer faced another challenge.</p>

    <div class="riddle">
        <p><strong>Riddle 4:</strong> The more of this there is, the less you see. What is it?</p>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">Show Answer</button>
        <p class="answer" id="answer4">Darkness.</p>
    </div>

    <p>With a grin, the wanderer knew they were getting closer to the end of their adventure.</p>

    <div class="riddle">
        <p><strong>Riddle 5:</strong> What is so fragile that saying its name breaks it?</p>
        <button onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">Show Answer</button>
        <p class="answer" id="answer5">Silence.</p>
    </div>

    <p>With the final riddle solved, the wanderer thanked the wise old owl and continued their journey, enriched with knowledge and joy from the riddles encountered along the way.</p>
